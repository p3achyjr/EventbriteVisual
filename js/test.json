New computational models like convolutional neural networks for pattern recognition are replacing programming with training. Responsive systems are evolving new hardware and software layers that shift the most commonly executed functions to low-power subsystems - even while driving richer functionality into less-frequently functions into the cloud. \nDistributed applications are not just spread across multiple processors on a chip, or multiple boards in a rack, but distributed across mobile and IoT devices, network gateways and servers sometimes on the opposite side of the globe from the user. These radically distributed systems drive a dramatic readjustment of trade-offs between computing and communication. Taken together, these changes represent a seismic shift in the computing landscape, with a new imperative to closely understand the flow of data, the energy cost of computing and alternatives to conventional software development. \n\u00a0 \nSpeaker Bios   \nDr. Chris Rowen is the Chief Technology Officer for Cadence\u2019s IP Group. He is developing\u00a0extensible processor IP that can be configured easily into custom chips for applications in\u00a0wireless, peripheral control, imaging, and other areas. He joined Cadence after its acquisition of\u00a0Tensilica, the company he founded to develop extensible processors. He built Tensilica to the\u00a0point where its processors had more than 200 licensees, including seven of the top 10 chip\u00a0companies, who had shipped more than 2 billion cores. Before founding Tensilica, he was VP\u00a0and General Manager of the Design Reuse Group at Synopsys. He also was a pioneer in\u00a0developing RISC architecture and helped start MIPS Computer Systems, where he was Vice\u00a0President for Microprocessor Development. He holds an MSEE and PhD in electrical\u00a0engineering from Stanford (working under John Hennessy) and a BA in physics from Harvard. \n\u00a0 \nNote : The doors close at 7:30 PM\u00a0 \n\n\u00a0 \nTwitter:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0twitter.com/IEEEComputerSoc Facebook:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=323745186971 LinkedIn:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=2606895 Web site:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0http://computer.ieeesiliconvalley.org Subscribe to email news:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0http://listserv.ieee.org/cgi-bin/wa?SUBED1=cs-chap-scv&A=1 ",

                "text": "Retinoblastoma (Rb) is one of the most common childhood cancers. The cardinal symptom of Rb is called leukocoria, or \"white eye\".

Students are particularly welcomed. \nAbstracts: \n'Leaving it Open: From Sparse Experiences to Sparse Reality' Helen Yetter-Chappell (York)  \nI argue that both experiences and reality can be a great deal more \"sparse\" than you might initially believe. There can be experiences that are determinately phenomenally warm-colored, but not any particular warm shade; there can be experiences of objects standing in spatial relations to one another, but not any particular spatial relations; there can be experiences of triangles, that aren't determinately equilateral, isosceles, or scalene, for the relationships between the lengths of sides and angles are \"left open\". Further, for each such \"sparse\" experience, there is a corresponding possible world. There are possible worlds in which objects stand in spatial relations to one another, but not any particular spatial relations \u2014 e.g. in which one object is determinately above another, but where their horizontal positions are left open. There are possible worlds in which there are triangles that are not determinately equilateral, isosceles, or scalene.   \n'The Theory-ladenness of Recalcitrant Emotions'  Raamy Majeed (Cambridge) and Alex Grzankowski (Cambridge and Texas Tech)  There are familiar cases of recalcitrant emotions, e.g. believing that flying is safe, but fearing it nevertheless. In much of the literature, recalcitrant emotions are wheeled in as puzzling cases for a competing view, though very often the data itself ends up driven by the very theories under question. We believe that there has been insufficient theory-neutral discussion of recalcitrant emotions and that, in fact, it is less than obvious that there is a theory neural puzzle that needs to be dealt with. So, we think, it is worthwhile to look at the data from a theory-neutral perspective. It is worthwhile both in its own right and also because of the light it sheds on the landscape of the emotions. We each offer our own upshot on the basis of this assessment. One of us (Majeed) argues that the recalcitrant nature of recalcitrant emotions has been exaggerated in that they are receptive to top-down cognitive influences. The other (Grzankowski) argues that a richer landscape with respect to recalcitrance also gives way to a richer landscape for theorizing about the intentionality and normative assessability of the emotions which has too often been couched in terms of propositional contents. We end by exploring the consequences of these for the various ways emotion theorists handle recalcitrant emotions.  \n'Pain Eliminativism' Jennifer Corns (Glasgow)  \nTraditional eliminativism is the view that a term should be eliminated from everyday speech due to failures of reference. Following Edouard Machery, we may distinguish this traditional eliminativism about a kind and its term from a scientific eliminativism according to which a term should be eliminated from scientific discourse due to a lack of referential utility. The distinction matters if any terms are rightly retained for daily life despite being rightly eliminated from scientific inquiry. In this article, I argue that while scientific eliminativism for pain may be plausible, traditional eliminativism for pain is not. I discuss the pain eliminativisms offered by Daniel Dennett and Valerie Hardcastle and argue that both theorists, at best, provide support for scientific eliminativism for pain, but leave the folk-psychological notion of pain unscathed. One might, however, think that scientific eliminativism itself entails traditional eliminativism\u2014for pain and any other kind and corresponding term. I argue that this is not the case. Scientific eliminativism for pain does not entail traditional eliminativism about anything. ",

On the way, you\u2019ll find out what it was like to discover the Higgs boson, why neutrinos could be the key to a theory of everything, what the missing matter of the universe might be made of, and how particle physics has quietly transformed our everyday lives. \nHosted by acclaimed author Michael Brooks, our one-day masterclass offers the chance to learn directly from the experts in this fascinating field. \n  \nSpeakers: \n- \u00a0Jon Butterworth -\u00a0professor of physics at University College London and author of\u00a0Smashing Physics: The Inside Story of the Hunt for the Higgs, shortlisted for the Royal Society Winton Prize for Science Books 2015 \n- \u00a0David Wark - professor in\u00a0experimental particle physics at the University of Oxford and Director of the Particle Physics Division at Rutherford Appleton Laboratory \n- \u00a0Val Gibson - professor in high energy physics at the University of Cambridge and UK Spokesperson for the LHCb experiment at the Large Hadron Collider \n- \u00a0Tara Shears - professor of experimental particle physics at the University of Liverpool \n- \u00a0Tom Whyntie - public engagement fellow at the School of Physics and Astronomy, Queen Mary University of London and author of Introducing Particle Physics: A Graphic Guide \n- \u00a0Chamkaur Ghag\u00a0-\u00a0astroparticle physicist within the High Energy Physics Group at University College London \n- \u00a0Hosted by\u00a0Michael Brooks,\u00a0New Scientist\u00a0consultant and author of bestseller\u00a013 Things That Don't Make Sense \n  \nOverview: \nOur best description of matter is so concise that it fits on a T-shirt. Known as the standard model, it paints a mathematical picture of matter at the most fundamental level and of the forces that glue it all together. And it does a brilliant job. Ingenious experiments have tested it to destruction \u2013 most famously, at the Large Hadron Collider, which found the Higgs boson, the last missing piece of the standard model, in 2012. \nYet plenty of mysteries remain. The discovery of the Higgs has raised more even questions than it answered. How do neutrinos get their mass? What is dark matter? Where did all the antimatter go? What does all this mean for a theory of everything? \nIn attempting to answer such frontier questions, physicists have devised technologies that have revolutionised our lives from the World Wide Web and neural networks to faster, targeted cancer therapies.\u00a0 \nJoin our speakers on a mind-expanding journey through the world of particle physics. \n  \nTopics covered will include: \n\nSecrets of the Higgs boson\nWhy the standard model is only the beginning\nThe mystery of existence: why is there something rather than nothing?\nHow to hunt for dark matter\nWhat\u00a0neutrinos are trying to tell us about the universe\nCan we find a theory of everything?\nWhat particle physics has done for us\n\n  \nWho should attend? \nYou are curious about particle physics\u00a0and want a step-by-step guide without mathematics.\u00a0Popular articles have whetted your appetite, yet you have struggled to understand physics textbooks.\u00a0You want to learn about the frontiers of research from scientists at the coalface. \n  \nWhat's included: \n\nEngaging talks from 6 leading experts in experimental and theoretical particle physics\nAsk-an-expert Question Time session\nYour chance to meet the speakers and host Michael Brooks\nBuffet lunch, plus morning and afternoon refreshments\nExclusive Instant Expert certificate\nExclusive New Scientist\u00a0subscription deal, book and merchandise offers\n\n  \nBooking information: \n\nThe event will be held in the Brunei Auditorium at RCGP / 30 Euston Square.\nDoors to the Auditorium will open at 9:15am, talks will commence at 10am sharp.

Since the success of Alex Krizhevsky\u2019s Convolutional Neural\u00a0Network (CNN) on the ImageNet classification benchmark in 2012, deep neural networks have begun to\u00a0dominate different areas in computer vision. Nowadays, some consider object classification to be an\u00a0almost-solved problem, or at least in the regime of large amounts of data. Similarly, image segmentation has\u00a0been massively improved through deep learning techniques. However, the lack of labelled data for supervised\u00a0learning prohibits the application of large, vanilla CNNs to certain problem domains. Recent work has\u00a0focused on how to tackle these more difficult challenges by combining traditional computer vision techniques\u00a0with deep learning, as well as advancing more traditional deep learning methods themselves.\u00a0The aim of the workshop is to explore not just the areas of computer vision that deep learning can advance,\u00a0but also how the investigation of different areas in computer vision has led to advances in deep learning. On\u00a0the one hand, more sophisticated architectures and training methodologies can be used to tackle more\u00a0complex problems in computer vision. On the other hand, the domain of spatial and temporal dimensions in\u00a0computer vision can be more intuitively explored by humans, leading to a better understanding of what, and\u00a0possibly why, deep neural networks learn what they do. In particular, visualisation techniques have great\u00a0potential in helping us understand both the models and the data that we work with. \n Topics of Interest With respect to computer vision, the areas of interest covered by this meeting include the following: \u2022 Neural network architectures \u2022 Deep learning optimisation techniques \u2022 Visualisation of learned representations \u2022 Practical applications of deep learning \u2022 Generative neural network models \u2022 Hybrid traditional CV/deep learning systems \n\u00a0 ",

Perry, M.D., Ph.D.\u00a0 \nDr. Perry is the Senior Fellow of The ChildTrauma Academy, a not-for-profit organization based\u00a0in Houston, TX and adjunct Professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences\u00a0at the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern\u00a0University in Chicago. \nDr. Perry is the author, with Maia Szalavitz, of The Boy\u00a0Who Was Raised As A Dog, a bestselling book based\u00a0on his work with maltreated children and Born For\u00a0Love: Why Empathy is Essential and Endangered. His\u00a0most recent multimedia book, BRIEF: Reflections on\u00a0Childhood, Trauma and Society was released in 2013.\u00a0Over the last thirty years, Dr. Perry has been an active\u00a0teacher, clinician and researcher in children\u2019s mental\u00a0health and the neurosciences holding a variety of\u00a0academic positions. \nDr. Perry was on the faculty of the Departments of Pharmacology and Psychiatry at the\u00a0University of Chicago School Of Medicine from 1988 to 1991. From 1992 to 2001, Dr. Perry\u00a0served as the Trammell Research Professor of Child Psychiatry at Baylor College of Medicine in\u00a0Houston, Texas. During this time, Dr. Perry also was Chief of Psychiatry for Texas Children's\u00a0Hospital and Vice-Chairman for Research within the Department of Psychiatry. From 2001 to\u00a02003, Dr. Perry served as the Medical Director for Provincial Programs in Children's Mental\u00a0Health for the Alberta Mental Health Board. He continues to consult with the government of\u00a0Alberta on children\u2019s issues and serves as a founding member of the Premier\u2019s Council of\u00a0Alberta\u2019s Promise. \nDr. Perry has conducted both basic neuroscience and clinical research. His neuroscience\u00a0research has examined the effects of prenatal drug exposure on brain development, the\u00a0neurobiology of human neuropsychiatric disorders, the neurophysiology of traumatic life events\u00a0and basic mechanisms related to the development of neurotransmitter receptors in the brain.\u00a0His clinical research and practice has focused on high-risk children. This work has examined the\u00a0cognitive, behavioral, emotional, social, and physiological effects of neglect and trauma in\u00a0children, adolescents and adults. This work has been instrumental in describing how childhood\u00a0experiences, including neglect and traumatic stress, change the biology of the brain \u2013 and,\u00a0thereby, the health of the child. \nHis clinical research over the last ten years has been focused on integrating emerging\u00a0principles of developmental neuroscience into clinical practice. This work has resulted in the\u00a0development of innovative clinical practices and programs working with maltreated and\u00a0traumatized children, most prominently the Neurosequential Model\u00a9, a developmentally\u00a0sensitive, neurobiology-informed approach to clinical work (NMT), education (NME) and\u00a0caregiving (NMC). This approach to clinical problem solving has been integrated into the\u00a0programs at dozens of large public and non-profit organizations serving at-risk children and\u00a0their families. \nHis experience as a clinician and a researcher with traumatized children has led many\u00a0community and governmental agencies to consult Dr. Perry following high-profile incidents\u00a0involving traumatized children such as the Branch Davidian siege in Waco (1993), the\u00a0Oklahoma City bombing (1995), the Columbine school shootings (1999), the September 11th\u00a0terrorist attacks (2001), Hurricane Katrina (2005), the FLDS polygamist sect (2008), the earthquake in Haiti (2010), the tsunami in Tohoku Japan (2011) and the Sandy Hook\u00a0Elementary school shootings (2012). \nDr. Perry is the author of over 500 journal articles, book chapters and scientific proceedings\u00a0and is the recipient of numerous professional awards and honors, including the T. Berry\u00a0Brazelton Infant Mental Health Advocacy Award, the Award for Leadership in Public Child\u00a0Welfare, the Alberta Centennial Medal and the 2014 Kohl Education Prize. \nHe has presented about child maltreatment, children's mental health, neurodevelopment and\u00a0youth violence in a variety of venues including policy-making bodies such as the White House\u00a0Summit on Violence, the California Assembly and U.S. House Committee on Education. Dr.\u00a0Perry has been featured in a wide range of media including National Public Radio, The Today\u00a0Show, Good Morning America, Nightline, CNN, MSNBC, NBC, ABC and CBS News and the\u00a0Oprah Winfrey Show. His work has been featured in documentaries produced by Dateline\u00a0NBC, 20/20, the BBC, Nightline, CBC, PBS, as well as dozen international documentaries.\u00a0Many print media have highlighted the clinical and research activities of Dr. Perry including a\u00a0Pulitzer-prize winning series in the Chicago Tribune, US News and World Report, Time,\u00a0Newsweek, Forbes ASAP, Washington Post, the New York Times and Rolling Stone. \nDr. Perry, a native of Bismarck, North Dakota, was an undergraduate at Stanford University and\u00a0Amherst College. He attended medical and graduate school at Northwestern University,\u00a0receiving both M.D. and Ph.D. degrees. Dr. Perry completed a residency in general psychiatry\u00a0at Yale University School of Medicine and a fellowship in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at\u00a0The University of Chicago. \n  \n  ",

This approach to clinical problem solving has been integrated into the\u00a0programs at dozens of large public and non-profit organizations serving at-risk children and\u00a0their families.<\/P>\n<P>His experience as a clinician and a researcher with traumatized children has led many\u00a0community and governmental agencies to consult Dr. Perry following high-profile incidents\u00a0involving traumatized children such as the Branch Davidian siege in Waco (1993), the\u00a0Oklahoma City bombing (1995), the Columbine school shootings (1999), the September 11th\u00a0terrorist attacks (2001), Hurricane Katrina (2005), the FLDS polygamist sect (2008), the earthquake in Haiti (2010), the tsunami in Tohoku Japan (2011) and the Sandy Hook\u00a0Elementary school shootings (2012).<\/P>\n<P>Dr. Perry is the author of over 500 journal articles, book chapters and scientific proceedings\u00a0and is the recipient of numerous professional awards and honors, including the T. Berry\u00a0Brazelton Infant Mental Health Advocacy Award, the Award for Leadership in Public Child\u00a0Welfare, the Alberta Centennial Medal and the 2014 Kohl Education Prize.<\/P>\n<P>He has presented about child maltreatment, children's mental health, neurodevelopment and\u00a0youth violence in a variety of venues including policy-making bodies such as the White House\u00a0Summit on Violence, the California Assembly and U.S. House Committee on Education. Dr.\u00a0Perry has been featured in a wide range of media including National Public Radio, The Today\u00a0Show, Good Morning America, Nightline, CNN, MSNBC, NBC, ABC and CBS News and the\u00a0Oprah Winfrey Show. His work has been featured in documentaries produced by Dateline\u00a0NBC, 20/20, the BBC, Nightline, CBC, PBS, as well as dozen international documentaries.\u00a0Many print media have highlighted the clinical and research activities of Dr. Perry including a\u00a0Pulitzer-prize winning series in the Chicago Tribune, US News and World Report, Time,\u00a0Newsweek, Forbes ASAP, Washington Post, the New York Times and Rolling Stone.<\/P>\n<P>Dr. Perry, a native of Bismarck, North Dakota, was an undergraduate at Stanford University and\u00a0Amherst College. He attended medical and graduate school at Northwestern University,\u00a0receiving both M.D. and Ph.D. degrees. Dr. Perry completed a residency in general psychiatry\u00a0at Yale University School of Medicine and a fellowship in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at\u00a0The University of Chicago.<\/P>\n<P><BR><\/P>\n<P><BR><\/P>"

                "text": "This course is an introduction to a range of fundamental skills, techniques and tools for those aspiring to become Data Scientists. These include Big Data, Machine Learning and Cloud Computing. \nData Science, Predictive Modelling and Big Data skills are of vital and growing importance in commercial, government, commercial \u00a0and not-for-profit organisations. Those in the Management, Product, Risk and IT functions benefit from skills and literacy in this area. \nThis two-day course introduces a range of \u00a0techniques as they are commonly used in business, and provides practical experience in their use.\u00a0No prior knowledge of R is required. \n\u00a0 \nCourse outline \nThis course will provide a conceptual overview and practical hands-on experience of a wide range of key tools, techniques and processes. \nAt the heart of the data mining toolkit is the suite of predictive modelling methods. Accordingly, the course will develop attendees' literacy in the strengths, characteristics and correct application of a range of predictive modelling methods, from relatively simple linear models through to complex and powerful Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting Machines and Neural Networks will be covered along the way. \nIt will also teach the correct framing of predictive modelling problems, suitably preparing data, evaluating model accuracy and stability, interpreting results and interrogating models. \nThe two key styles of predictive modelling \u2013 operational for targeting and explanatory for insights \u2013 will be described and distinguished. \nAs well as predictive modelling, the course will cover a range of other key data mining tools, including: \n\nData exploration and visualisation: univariate summaries, correlation matrices, heat maps, hierarchical clustering.\nCluster analysis \u2013 used for customer segmentation and anomaly detection\nOther \"unsupervised\" outlier detection tools.\n\nThis course will primarily be taught using Rattle, a graphical interface for predictive modelling and data science in R. Participants will be exposed to \"Big Data\" techniques as applied to machine learning and deployed on Cloud Computing platforms. \n  \nAdditional topics  \nThe following additional topics may be covered depending on the pace and interests of the class:  \n\nPrincipal components analysis \u2013 used to segment and interpret multivariate data.\nLink and network a nalysis visualisation \u2013 which provide a simple and compelling way to communicate and analyse relationships, and are commonly applied in forensics, human resources and law enforcement.\nAssociation analysis \u2013 used in retail market basket analysis and the assessment of risk groupings.\nFrequent item set analysis.\n\n\u00a0 \nWho should attend? \nThis course is suitable for anyone in management, administrative, product, marketing, finance, risk and IT roles who works with data and wants to become acquainted with modern data analysis tools. \n\u00a0 \nPrerequisites \nNo prior knowledge of R is required to take this course. \n\u00a0\nCourse outcomes \nAttendees should, by the end of the course: \n\nLearn fundamentals of predictive modelling and experience using a range of methods.\u00a0\nHave improved their ability to assess the effectiveness and fitness for purpose of any predictive modelling tool or technique.\u00a0\nHave experience with a range of unsupervised data techniques.\nBe exposed to Big Data and Cloud Computing applications.\n\n  \nMeals and refreshments \nMorning tea, lunch, and afternoon tea will be provided. \n\u00a0 \nCourse instructor \nThe course will be led by Presciient director Dr Eugene Dubossarsky or another Presciient instructor.\u00a0 \nDr Dubossarsky is the head of the Sydney Users of R Forum. Eugene is also Principal Founder of Analyst First, an international analytics industry organisation. He is a founder of the Institute of Analytics Professionals of Australia (IAPA); Director, University of New South Wales School of Mathematics and Statistics Industry Advisory Board; and a recognised industry leader in Business Analytics.

As a beginner in R, I thought that it might be a bit\u00a0overwhelming. But I was wrong! Eugene did a fantastic job at\u00a0explaining\u00a0the concepts and all practical work was engaging and easy to follow. Entertaining, informative and most importantly relevant - it has already proven valuable in my work. \n\u2014Sanja Djekic -\u00a0Data Manager/Analyst at South Western Sydney Local Health District \n  \nI attended the Predictive Analytics course presented by Eugene Dubossarsky from presciient.com in March of 2013 in North Sydney. I am primarily a computer scientist, and have a broad but very shallow knowledge of the area of machine learning and analytics. The course gave me a very good starting point to start gaining a deep knowledge of the topic. The tooling presented gives an excellent place to start learning and is useful beyond the class setting. I think the key value of the course is that it was presented by a domain expert who is passionate about the topic and growing the maturity of the field; and so was very open with the sorts of insights that you don't read in a text book. This included the high level concepts within analytics, models of thinking about analytic problems and key lessons from his career implementing predictive analytics. I therefore left the course knowing what I don't know, and knowing where to start, which is more than I expected. I would recommend it to any computer scientist. \n\u2014Quinton Anderson - Chief Technology Officer /Lead Software Engineer at IZAZI Solutions \n\u00a0 \nDiscounts \nPlease ask about our discounts for group bookings \n  \nFeedback \nUse enquiries@presciient.com to email us any questions about the course, including requests for more detail, or for specific content you would like to see covered, or queries regarding prerequisites and suitability. \nIf you would like to attend but for any reason cannot, please also let us know. \n  \nCancellation \nAll bookings are made with the understanding that courses may be cancelled up to 5 working days before running, with all fees refunded. \n  \nVariation \nCourse material may vary from advertised due to demands and learning pace of attendees.

                "text": "This course is an introduction to a range of fundamental skills, techniques and tools for those aspiring to become Data Scientists. These include Big Data, Machine Learning and Cloud Computing. \nData Science, Predictive Modelling and Big Data skills are of vital and growing importance in commercial, government, commercial \u00a0and not-for-profit organisations. Those in the Management, Product, Risk and IT functions benefit from skills and literacy in this area. \nThis two-day course introduces a range of \u00a0techniques as they are commonly used in business, and provides practical experience in their use.\u00a0No prior knowledge of R is required. \n\u00a0 \nCourse outline \nThis course will provide a conceptual overview and practical hands-on experience of a wide range of key tools, techniques and processes. \nAt the heart of the data mining toolkit is the suite of predictive modelling methods. Accordingly, the course will develop attendees' literacy in the strengths, characteristics and correct application of a range of predictive modelling methods, from relatively simple linear models through to complex and powerful Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting Machines and Neural Networks will be covered along the way. \nIt will also teach the correct framing of predictive modelling problems, suitably preparing data, evaluating model accuracy and stability, interpreting results and interrogating models. \nThe two key styles of predictive modelling \u2013 operational for targeting and explanatory for insights \u2013 will be described and distinguished. \nAs well as predictive modelling, the course will cover a range of other key data mining tools, including: \n\nData exploration and visualisation: univariate summaries, correlation matrices, heat maps, hierarchical clustering.\nCluster analysis \u2013 used for customer segmentation and anomaly detection\nOther \"unsupervised\" outlier detection tools.\n\nThis course will primarily be taught using Rattle, a graphical interface for predictive modelling and data science in R. Participants will be exposed to \"Big Data\" techniques as applied to machine learning and deployed on Cloud Computing platforms. \n  \nAdditional topics  \nThe following additional topics may be covered depending on the pace and interests of the class:  \n\nPrincipal components analysis \u2013 used to segment and interpret multivariate data.\nLink and network a nalysis visualisation \u2013 which provide a simple and compelling way to communicate and analyse relationships, and are commonly applied in forensics, human resources and law enforcement.\nAssociation analysis \u2013 used in retail market basket analysis and the assessment of risk groupings.\nFrequent item set analysis.\n\n\u00a0 \nWho should attend? \nThis course is suitable for anyone in management, administrative, product, marketing, finance, risk and IT roles who works with data and wants to become acquainted with modern data analysis tools. \n\u00a0 \nPrerequisites \nNo prior knowledge of R is required to take this course. \n\u00a0\nCourse outcomes \nAttendees should, by the end of the course: \n\nLearn fundamentals of predictive modelling and experience using a range of methods.\u00a0\nHave improved their ability to assess the effectiveness and fitness for purpose of any predictive modelling tool or technique.\u00a0\nHave experience with a range of unsupervised data techniques.\nBe exposed to Big Data and Cloud Computing applications.\n\n  \nMeals and refreshments \nMorning tea, lunch, and afternoon tea will be provided. \n\u00a0 \nCourse instructor \nThe course will be led by Presciient director Dr Eugene Dubossarsky or another Presciient instructor.\u00a0 \nDr Dubossarsky is the head of the Sydney Users of R Forum. Eugene is also Principal Founder of Analyst First, an international analytics industry organisation. He is a founder of the Institute of Analytics Professionals of Australia (IAPA); Director, University of New South Wales School of Mathematics and Statistics Industry Advisory Board; and a recognised industry leader in Business Analytics. Eugene is an experienced, analytics professional of 20 years' experience programming in R and its parent language, S.\u00a0 \n\u00a0 \nTestimonials \nThank you very much for the information I gathered \u00a0at the Predictive Modeling course I attended recently. As a beginner in R, I thought that it might be a bit\u00a0overwhelming. But I was wrong! Eugene did a fantastic job at\u00a0explaining\u00a0the concepts and all practical work was engaging and easy to follow. Entertaining, informative and most importantly relevant - it has already proven valuable in my work. \n\u2014Sanja Djekic -\u00a0Data Manager/Analyst at South Western Sydney Local Health District \n  \nI attended the Predictive Analytics course presented by Eugene Dubossarsky from presciient.com in March of 2013 in North Sydney. I am primarily a computer scientist, and have a broad but very shallow knowledge of the area of machine learning and analytics. The course gave me a very good starting point to start gaining a deep knowledge of the topic. The tooling presented gives an excellent place to start learning and is useful beyond the class setting. I think the key value of the course is that it was presented by a domain expert who is passionate about the topic and growing the maturity of the field; and so was very open with the sorts of insights that you don't read in a text book. This included the high level concepts within analytics, models of thinking about analytic problems and key lessons from his career implementing predictive analytics. I therefore left the course knowing what I don't know, and knowing where to start, which is more than I expected. I would recommend it to any computer scientist. \n\u2014Quinton Anderson - Chief Technology Officer /Lead Software Engineer at IZAZI Solutions \n\u00a0 \nDiscounts \nPlease ask about our discounts for group bookings \n  \nFeedback \nUse enquiries@presciient.com to email us any questions about the course, including requests for more detail, or for specific content you would like to see covered, or queries regarding prerequisites and suitability. \nIf you would like to attend but for any reason cannot, please also let us know. \n  \nCancellation \nAll bookings are made with the understanding that courses may be cancelled up to 5 working days before running, with all fees refunded. \n  \nVariation \nCourse material may vary from advertised due to demands and learning pace of attendees.

Each course integrates three core disciplines of contemplative learning: knowledge, meditation, and action, and involves weekly two-hour classes, homework practice based on assigned texts and meditations, as well as a final, take-home essay exam. Courses culminate with a daylong retreat, reinforcing the insights, skills, and life strategies taught in the preceding classes. \n The Hero\u2019s Journey: Creating Your Dream Life and Self,\u00a0(Year Three/Course Six in the Sustainable Happiness series), is taught by Dr. Pilar Jennings. The Tibetan art of role-modeling imagery and affirmation is designed to replace the childhood struggles and traumas that loop though our minds, with an empowering, optimistic rehearsal of our vision of a dream self and life. Centered around our bond with a role-model who inspires our unsung inner hero, this vision acts like the simulator pilots use to train for real flight: it primes the neural networks we need to support our active creation of that ideal self and life. This sixth class of the Nalanda Institute Four Year Program in Sustainable Happiness takes the art of transformative imagery into the fabric of our daily lives. Dr. Jennings explores the use of imagery and affirmation to rewrite the supposed facts of our life\u2014birth, development and death\u2014into a heroic narrative: dying to our reactive self, resurrecting as our native genius/dream self, and giving birth to a generative way of being that manifests our mature genius for transformation. \nPractically, the class focuses on sealing narrative imagery with lucid dignity, and accessing the subtle neural network of blissful openness, based on Tibetan role-modeling practices.\u00a0\u00a0 \nPrerequisites: initial familiarity with mindfulness, loving-kindness, and an openness to the path of transformation. This course is open to all, whether or not you\u2019ve taken the previous course in the program. \nFor more information on the Nalanda Institute for Contemplative Science, please visit:\u00a0www.nalandainstitute.org \nMondays, April 11, 18, 25, May 2, 9, 16, 7-9pm ",

                "text": "This course is an introduction to a range of fundamental skills, techniques and tools for those aspiring to become Data Scientists. These include Big Data, Machine Learning and Cloud Computing. \nData Science, Predictive Modelling and Big Data skills are of vital and growing importance in commercial, government, commercial \u00a0and not-for-profit organisations. Those in the Management, Product, Risk and IT functions benefit from skills and literacy in this area. \nThis two-day course introduces a range of \u00a0techniques as they are commonly used in business, and provides practical experience in their use.\u00a0No prior knowledge of R is required. \n\u00a0 \nCourse outline \nThis course will provide a conceptual overview and practical hands-on experience of a wide range of key tools, techniques and processes. \nAt the heart of the data mining toolkit is the suite of predictive modelling methods. Accordingly, the course will develop attendees' literacy in the strengths, characteristics and correct application of a range of predictive modelling methods, from relatively simple linear models through to complex and powerful Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting Machines and Neural Networks will be covered along the way. \nIt will also teach the correct framing of predictive modelling problems, suitably preparing data, evaluating model accuracy and stability, interpreting results and interrogating models. \nThe two key styles of predictive modelling \u2013 operational for targeting and explanatory for insights \u2013 will be described and distinguished. \nAs well as predictive modelling, the course will cover a range of other key data mining tools, including: \n\nData exploration and visualisation: univariate summaries, correlation matrices, heat maps, hierarchical clustering.\nCluster analysis \u2013 used for customer segmentation and anomaly detection\nOther \"unsupervised\" outlier detection tools.\n\nThis course will primarily be taught using Rattle, a graphical interface for predictive modelling and data science in R. Participants will be exposed to \"Big Data\" techniques as applied to machine learning and deployed on Cloud Computing platforms. \n  \nAdditional topics  \nThe following additional topics may be covered depending on the pace and interests of the class:  \n\nPrincipal components analysis \u2013 used to segment and interpret multivariate data.\nLink and network a nalysis visualisation \u2013 which provide a simple and compelling way to communicate and analyse relationships, and are commonly applied in forensics, human resources and law enforcement.\nAssociation analysis \u2013 used in retail market basket analysis and the assessment of risk groupings.\nFrequent item set analysis.\n\n\u00a0 \nWho should attend? \nThis course is suitable for anyone in management, administrative, product, marketing, finance, risk and IT roles who works with data and wants to become acquainted with modern data analysis tools. \n\u00a0 \nPrerequisites \nNo prior knowledge of R is required to take this course. \n\u00a0\nCourse outcomes \nAttendees should, by the end of the course: \n\nLearn fundamentals of predictive modelling and experience using a range of methods.\u00a0\nHave improved their ability to assess the effectiveness and fitness for purpose of any predictive modelling tool or technique.\u00a0\nHave experience with a range of unsupervised data techniques.\nBe exposed to Big Data and Cloud Computing applications.\n\n  \nMeals and refreshments \nMorning tea, lunch, and afternoon tea will be provided. \n\u00a0 \nCourse instructor \nThe course will be led by Presciient director Dr Eugene Dubossarsky or another Presciient instructor.\u00a0 \nDr Dubossarsky is the head of the Sydney Users of R Forum. Eugene is also Principal Founder of Analyst First, an international analytics industry organisation. He is a founder of the Institute of Analytics Professionals of Australia (IAPA); Director, University of New South Wales School of Mathematics and Statistics Industry Advisory Board; and a recognised industry leader in Business Analytics. Eugene is an experienced, analytics professional of 20 years' experience programming in R and its parent language, S.\u00a0 \n\u00a0 \nTestimonials \nThank you very much for the information I gathered \u00a0at the Predictive Modeling course I attended recently. As a beginner in R, I thought that it might be a bit\u00a0overwhelming. But I was wrong! Eugene did a fantastic job at\u00a0explaining\u00a0the concepts and all practical work was engaging and easy to follow. Entertaining, informative and most importantly relevant - it has already proven valuable in my work. \n\u2014Sanja Djekic -\u00a0Data Manager/Analyst at South Western Sydney Local Health District \n  \nI attended the Predictive Analytics course presented by Eugene Dubossarsky from presciient.com in March of 2013 in North Sydney. I am primarily a computer scientist, and have a broad but very shallow knowledge of the area of machine learning and analytics. The course gave me a very good starting point to start gaining a deep knowledge of the topic. The tooling presented gives an excellent place to start learning and is useful beyond the class setting. I think the key value of the course is that it was presented by a domain expert who is passionate about the topic and growing the maturity of the field; and so was very open with the sorts of insights that you don't read in a text book. This included the high level concepts within analytics, models of thinking about analytic problems and key lessons from his career implementing predictive analytics. I therefore left the course knowing what I don't know, and knowing where to start, which is more than I expected. I would recommend it to any computer scientist. \n\u2014Quinton Anderson - Chief Technology Officer /Lead Software Engineer at IZAZI Solutions \n\u00a0 \nDiscounts \nPlease ask about our discounts for group bookings \n  \nFeedback \nUse enquiries@presciient.com to email us any questions about the course, including requests for more detail, or for specific content you would like to see covered, or queries regarding prerequisites and suitability. \nIf you would like to attend but for any reason cannot, please also let us know. \n  \nCancellation \nAll bookings are made with the understanding that courses may be cancelled up to 5 working days before running, with all fees refunded. \n  \nVariation \nCourse material may vary from advertised due to demands and learning pace of attendees.

Participants will be able to prepare data, create and validate predictive models, deploy models, and will be ready to extend their knowledge to advanced topics such as RapidMiner Server: Web Apps and Deployment, Big Data Analtyics with RapidMiner Radoop, and Text Mining with RapidMiner.  \n\u00a0 \nPractical exercises during the course prepare students to take the knowledge gained and apply to their own respective data mining problems, solving them quickly and easily. Since the class labs are hands-on and performed on the participants\u2019 personal laptops, students will take actual classwork home with them, which will provide a jumpstart to the real world. \n  \nTarget Audience \nAnalysts, Developers, and Administrators \n\u00a0 \nPrerequisites \nBasic knowledge of computer programs and mathematics RapidMiner Basics Part 1  \n\u00a0 \nCourse Objectives \nAfter the training, students will have the ability to: \n\u00a0 \n\n\u00a0 Perform all common data preparations\n\u00a0 Build sophisticated analytical predictive models\n\u00a0 Evaluate model quality with respect to different criteria\n\u00a0 Deploy analytical predictive models \n\n\u00a0 \nCourse Outline \n\n\u00a0Overview\n\n- Business Case Changes \n- Intro Course Recap \n- Loading New Data \n\n\u00a0 EDA\n\n- Multiple Sources \n- Understanding New Attributes \n- Schema Relationships \n\n\u00a0Data Preparation\n\n- Joins \n- Aggregation \n- Multi-level Aggregation \n- Pivot \n- Set Theory \n- Calculated Values \n- Regular Expressions \n- Changing Value Types \n- Balancing Data \n- Outlier Detection \n- Feature Selection \n- Dimensionality Reduction \n\n\u00a0Predictive Models (sample varies)\n\n- SVM \n- Random Forest \n- k-Means Clustering \n- Neural Networks \n- Logistic Regression \n- Meta Learning \n\n\u00a0Model Evaluation\n\n- Advanced Performance Criteria \n- ROC Plots \n- Comparison between Models \n- Lift Chart \n- Significance Tests \n- Validation of Preprocessing and Preprocessing Models \n- Logging Results  \n\n\u00a0Deployment\n\n- Sharing Data, Models, and Processes \n- Exporting Processes as Web Service \n- Basics of Report Creation \n- Managing Processes and Services \n  \nWhat to Bring  \nYou\u00a0must\u00a0bring a laptop to class (Windows, Mac or Linux OS). \u00a0For Windows, Java Runtime Environment (JRE)\u00a0version 7\u00a0is required. \u00a0For Mac and Linux, Java Development Kit (JDK)\u00a0version 7\u00a0is needed. \u00a0Students will be provided with links to install RapidMiner Studio 6 prior to the class. \n\u00a0 \nRefund Policy  \nPlease email us at training@rapidminer.com no later than 10 days prior to the event to notify us that you cannot attend.

The practice of Yoga is about breath control, simple meditation and the adoption of specific bodily postures (asanas) which ultimately brings unending process of self-development and self-transformational. As this unique path strongly influence by the energy field through the atmosphere around us, the body and mind needs to habituate consciously and mindfully through time. In the aspect of this phenomenal truth, the New Age Yoga asserts an artistic for learning, growth and healing in an on going process of evolution. This creates an energetic path for the exchange, transference, expansion of the energy field and integrating with the entire universe flow to reach as a whole. It transcends the energetic operations for support life and bring harmony to the physical, mental and spiritual simplified as Avatar. In essence, YOGAVATAR New Age Yoga is an aspiration to humanity to aid to the path of Self-Knowledge based on the deep roots of Hatha Yoga. \nACCREDITATION \nYOGAVATAR is a registered school with Yoga Alliance. The teacher training programmes and teachers are internationally accredited, have exclusive recognition and qualify for the 200-hr Yoga Alliance Certification. \nYOGA ALLIANCE \nYoga Alliance is an international governing board for yoga teachers and training programmes in the U.S and globally. Graduates of our programme are automatically eligible to register as a RYT (Registered Yoga Teacher) with Yoga Alliance. Becoming a RYT means having a higher profile and gaining international recognition as a yoga teacher, attributes that many hiring studios look for. \nMISSION STATEMENT \nYOGAVATAR New Age Yoga School was created to provide quality instruction of New Age Yoga in a way that will be innovative, inspiring and transformative. Our goal is to assist others locally, nationally, and globally in creating abundant communities that support the shift of consciousness, from the inner process of yoga to the recognition that yoga is everywhere. \nINSPIRATIONS \nGROUNDED TO EARTH The roots of Hatha Yoga \nFeel GROUNDED\u00a0and SECURE: The Earth Element (Prithvi) in the body refers to our connection with the earth, the place where the raw elements for our bodies came from. We may bring more \u201cearth\u201d awareness into our yoga practice when we focus on grounding, building a firm base of support, connecting with the earth beneath us. Many times in our lives we become too \u201clofty\u201d in our thoughts and need to come down to Earth to feel grounded and secure. In balancing postures, for instance, our stability is facilitated through deepening our connection with the Earth. Sometimes the Earth also refers to the Planet that we call home\u2026exploring our connection with our Planet and the beauty and wonders that it holds\u2026 which we are all responsible to preserve. The Earth element is represented in the 1st/Root Chakra of the body. This style of yoga is suitable for beginners. Encourage proper alignment of the body and bring balance, strength, and calmness to the practitioner. \nFLOW WITH WATER Vinyasa Flow \nDYNAMIC\u00a0and FLUID\u00a0practice of yoga poses: The Water Element (Apah, Jala) in the body refers to the water that flows through our veins, or the circulatory system in the body. Health is only possible as the water element remains flowing in the body. While in our yoga postures (asanas) we may need to consciously increase the flow of blood into a particular area of the body. Sometimes the practice also takes on a flowing action, with one movement fluidly moving into the next. Water has almost magical properties and is essential to life (our bodies are 70% water), with incredible healing and cleansing powers. It is a universal symbol for the soul and is the element representing the 2nd/Sacral Chakra, the area where new life is generated. \nPOWER OF FIRE Core Strength & Balance \nSTRENGTH\u00a0is the focus and BALANCE\u00a0is the key: The Fire Element (Agni) in the body refers to the internal warmth and heat that is generated in certain postures, especially standing postures, and provides the energy and \u201cwill\u201d to go on even when we want to quit. It is the source of light and creates and destroys, symbolizing the soul in many beliefs. In our yoga practice, fire is of particular focus in standing postures and in our vinyasa flows, or in any posture where we wish to generate heat, power and resolve. Sometimes your hand (or your mental focus) may need to be placed in specific areas on your body to generate heat in those areas (i.e. your sacrum). It is the element representing the 3rd/Solar Plexus Chakra\u2026the brain for our body. \nENERGY IN THE AIR The Chi and\u00a0Pranayama \nYogic BREATHING\u00a0and CONCENTRATION: The Air Element (Vayu) in the body refers to both the breath and creating space in the body. The breath is the basis of all yoga, since without breath; yoga (or life, for that matter) does not exist. Air is what carries the vital energy or \u201cprana\u201d (\u201cchi\u201d in Chinese philosophy) throughout the body and the universe. It is the essence of all life and can be focused on in yoga practice by literally bringing space or air into specific areas of the body in the postures (such as increasing the spaces between the vertebrae of the spine\u2026lengthening). Pranayama, or breath control, sometimes means prolonging or restraining breath, but always requires a mindful awareness and all-encompassing focus on the breath. To practice breathing techniques is to initiate changes in the psychological, physical, neural and cerebral areas, increasing memory and creativity. It will strengthen your willpower and steady your mind. Air is the element representing the 4th/Heart Chakra. \nTHE UNION ETHER Spiritual Practice \nAWARENESS\u00a0and CONSCIOUSNESS. The Ether Element (Akasha) is most interesting! Lots to explore! Some describe it as a \u201chypothetical medium supposed to fill all space\u201d. Its adjective is \u201cethereal\u201d, meaning: \u201clight, airy, spiritual\u201d. Usually in yogic realms we refer to is as \u201cconsciousness\u201d. As we progress in our yoga practice, we become increasingly conscious. Conscious of our true self, our connection or honesty with our thought patterns and motivations. Sometimes it is achieved by bringing a keen awareness on a particular aspect that we need to become mindful of, conscious or enlightened about. Bringing light where there was darkness. This is when we take our yoga practice \u201coff the mat\u201d and begin to live our yoga practice in everything we do. We become aware of our true selves in all situations, not just \u201con the mat\u201d. Internalizing the Yamas and Niyamas and making them part of our life and lifestyle. This is not a destination, but rather a life-long process of progress and evolution. In our physical yoga practice we may bring the Ether element into the postures through focusing our awareness into very specific aspects of the posture or the body in the asana (posture). Bringing a focused awareness to, for instance, the internal massage of organs and glands deep inside the body that yoga helps to produce. Like a massage from the inside out. Ether is the element representing the 5th/Throat Chakra. \nFACULTY \n IRYNE YOGAVATAR (Lead Trainer for Module-3, Module-4, Module-5) \niRyne Yogavatar\u00a0is a new age yogini, the founder of YOGAVATAR New Age Yoga School and co-founder of\u00a0www.ispirit.asia.

Our goal is to assist others locally, nationally, and globally in creating abundant communities that support the shift of consciousness, from the inner process of yoga to the recognition that yoga is everywhere.<\/P>\n<H3 CLASS=\"colabs-sc-box normal\">INSPIRATIONS<\/H3>\n<P><STRONG>GROUNDED TO EARTH<BR><\/STRONG><STRONG>The roots of Hatha Yoga<\/STRONG><\/P>\n<P>Feel GROUNDED\u00a0and SECURE: The Earth Element (Prithvi) in the body refers to our connection with the earth, the place where the raw elements for our bodies came from. We may bring more \u201cearth\u201d awareness into our yoga practice when we focus on grounding, building a firm base of support, connecting with the earth beneath us. Many times in our lives we become too \u201clofty\u201d in our thoughts and need to come down to Earth to feel grounded and secure. In balancing postures, for instance, our stability is facilitated through deepening our connection with the Earth. Sometimes the Earth also refers to the Planet that we call home\u2026exploring our connection with our Planet and the beauty and wonders that it holds\u2026 which we are all responsible to preserve. The Earth element is represented in the 1st/Root Chakra of the body. This style of yoga is suitable for beginners. Encourage proper alignment of the body and bring balance, strength, and calmness to the practitioner.<\/P>\n<H4>FLOW WITH WATER<BR>Vinyasa Flow<\/H4>\n<P>DYNAMIC\u00a0and FLUID\u00a0practice of yoga poses: The Water Element (Apah, Jala) in the body refers to the water that flows through our veins, or the circulatory system in the body. Health is only possible as the water element remains flowing in the body. While in our yoga postures (asanas) we may need to consciously increase the flow of blood into a particular area of the body. Sometimes the practice also takes on a flowing action, with one movement fluidly moving into the next. Water has almost magical properties and is essential to life (our bodies are 70% water), with incredible healing and cleansing powers. It is a universal symbol for the soul and is the element representing the 2nd/Sacral Chakra, the area where new life is generated.<\/P>\n<H4>POWER OF FIRE<BR>Core Strength &amp; Balance<\/H4>\n<P>STRENGTH\u00a0is the focus and BALANCE\u00a0is the key: The Fire Element (Agni) in the body refers to the internal warmth and heat that is generated in certain postures, especially standing postures, and provides the energy and \u201cwill\u201d to go on even when we want to quit. It is the source of light and creates and destroys, symbolizing the soul in many beliefs. In our yoga practice, fire is of particular focus in standing postures and in our vinyasa flows, or in any posture where we wish to generate heat, power and resolve. Sometimes your hand (or your mental focus) may need to be placed in specific areas on your body to generate heat in those areas (i.e. your sacrum). It is the element representing the 3rd/Solar Plexus Chakra\u2026the brain for our body.<\/P>\n<H4>ENERGY IN THE AIR<BR>The Chi and\u00a0Pranayama<\/H4>\n<P>Yogic BREATHING\u00a0and CONCENTRATION: The Air Element (Vayu) in the body refers to both the breath and creating space in the body. The breath is the basis of all yoga, since without breath; yoga (or life, for that matter) does not exist. Air is what carries the vital energy or \u201cprana\u201d (\u201cchi\u201d in Chinese philosophy) throughout the body and the universe. It is the essence of all life and can be focused on in yoga practice by literally bringing space or air into specific areas of the body in the postures (such as increasing the spaces between the vertebrae of the spine\u2026lengthening). Pranayama, or breath control, sometimes means prolonging or restraining breath, but always requires a mindful awareness and all-encompassing focus on the breath. To practice breathing techniques is to initiate changes in the psychological, physical, neural and cerebral areas, increasing memory and creativity. It will strengthen your willpower and steady your mind. Air is the element representing the 4th/Heart Chakra.<\/P>\n<H4>THE UNION ETHER<BR>Spiritual Practice<\/H4>\n<P>AWARENESS\u00a0and CONSCIOUSNESS. The Ether Element (Akasha) is most interesting! Lots to explore! Some describe it as a \u201chypothetical medium supposed to fill all space\u201d. Its adjective is \u201cethereal\u201d, meaning: \u201clight, airy, spiritual\u201d. Usually in yogic realms we refer to is as \u201cconsciousness\u201d. As we progress in our yoga practice, we become increasingly conscious. Conscious of our true self, our connection or honesty with our thought patterns and motivations. Sometimes it is achieved by bringing a keen awareness on a particular aspect that we need to become mindful of, conscious or enlightened about. Bringing light where there was darkness. This is when we take our yoga practice \u201coff the mat\u201d and begin to live our yoga practice in everything we do. We become aware of our true selves in all situations, not just \u201con the mat\u201d. Internalizing the Yamas and Niyamas and making them part of our life and lifestyle. This is not a destination, but rather a life-long process of progress and evolution. In our physical yoga practice we may bring the Ether element into the postures through focusing our awareness into very specific aspects of the posture or the body in the asana (posture). Bringing a focused awareness to, for instance, the internal massage of organs and glands deep inside the body that yoga helps to produce. Like a massage from the inside out. Ether is the element representing the 5th/Throat Chakra.<\/P>\n<H3 CLASS=\"colabs-sc-box normal\">FACULTY<\/H3>\n<P><STRONG><IMG SRC=\"https://s.evbuc.com/https_proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ispirit.asia%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2015%2F09%2FP-iRyne-Camel-Var1.png&sig=ADR2i782IerM6iFwSM548hweBHwuZOjyqw\" ALT=\"iRyne YOGAVATAR Camel Var\"><BR><A HREF=\"http://www.ispirit.asia/yogavatar/\" REL=\"nofollow\"><IMG SRC=\"https://s.evbuc.com/https_proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ispirit.asia%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2015%2F09%2FP-Profile-iRyne-300x300.png&sig=ADR2i797sdlaavXwo6He6aTA2NUefLEzzA\" ALT=\"Profile iRyne YOGAVATAR\"><\/IMG><\/A>IRYNE YOGAVATAR<BR><\/STRONG><EM>(Lead Trainer for Module-3, Module-4, Module-5)<\/EM><\/P>\n<P>iRyne Yogavatar\u00a0is a new age yogini, the founder of YOGAVATAR New Age Yoga School and co-founder of\u00a0<A HREF=\"http://www.ispirit.asia/\" REL=\"nofollow\">www.ispirit.asia<\/A>.
